:bowtie: Hi there!
IamKevjn and I'm currently starting web development from scratch.

I started with HTML/CSS where I hardly try to format a possible upcoming personal website.

:cold_sweat: To be a minimum autonomous I would like to learn front-end (HTML, CSS and Javascript) and back-end (PHP, Python and SQL) languages.
