:bowtie: # Hi there !<br/>
**IamKevjn** and I'm currently starting _web development_ from scratch.

:book: I started with _HTML/CSS_ where I hardly try to format a possible upcoming personal website.

:cold_sweat: To be a minimum autonomous I would like to learn *front-end* and *back-end* languages.
