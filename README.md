# Hi there !ðŸ‘‹<br/>
:bowtie: **IamKevjn** and I'm currently starting _web development_ from scratch.

:book: I started with _HTML/CSS_ where I hardly try to format a possible upcoming personal website.

:cold_sweat: To be a minimum autonomous I would like to learn *front-end* and *back-end* languages.

|Front-End      |Back-End     |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|
|[x] HTML       | [ ] PHP     |
|[x] CSS        | [ ] Python  |
|[ ] Javascript | [ ] SQL     |
